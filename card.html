			<p class="main-text">This animal is very agile, with its opposable thumbs on the hands and feet and also with its long graceful limbs. It can be seen climbing easily in the trees, even if it spends about 60% of its time on the ground. The weight varies from 1,7 to 3,7 kg (3,75 to 8,0 lbs) with a length that doesn’t exceed 46 cm (18 in) without the tail. The ring-tailed lemur can be found exclusively in the south-western forests of the island of Madagascar. This lemur’s excellent vision aids in individual recognition. It lives in groups in which there are strong bonds maintained by numerous visual signals and sounds. The females are dominant and they are bound to their group for life whereas mature males will be chased away and will look to conquer other groups.
